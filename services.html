                          <p align="justify">Web Application VAPT is security testing methods for security holes or vulnerabilities in web applications and corporate websites. Due to these vulnerabilities, websites are left open for exploitation. Nowadays, companies are moving their most critical business and applications process on the web. There is no denying the fact that today, web apps are considered as vulnerability’s major point in the organizations.</p>
                          <blockquote style="text-align: center;">“One single Vulnerability is all an attacker needs.“</blockquote>
                          <p>The result of web application holes is theft of plenty of credit cards, paramount reputational and financial damage for a lot of enterprises, and also the compromise of several browsing machines that visited those websites which were attacked by hackers. To avoid a scenario like this, WAPT maintains complete security and that is the major reason why it holds utmost importance for an organization. Web Application Penetration Testing is designed for detecting security vulnerabilities within the web-based apps..</p>

                            <h4>Why Web Application Penetration Testing</h4>
                            <p align="justify">Advancements in the web services, web applications, as well as other technology have changed the approach of doing business as well as sharing and accessing the information. All these technological developments have also attracted scammers and malicious hackers who try to come up with the latest attack vectors to gain illegal money. Moreover, it is highly recommended to opt for Web Application Security Audit for rigorously pushing the defenses of Internet applications and networks.
                            In its most basic form, a Penetration test is considered as a method of assessing the computer system’s security by an attack’s simulation. Regarding the same, WAPT aims only on the evaluation of a web app’s security. Its procedure includes the application’s active analysis for any technical flaws, vulnerabilities, or weakness.

                          <p align="justify">According to various reports, over 70% of the attacks, in recent times, occur at an application level. As per several surveys conducted over the years, people are attacking through apps in the 21st century as it is easier than via network layer. Despite the common use of defenses like prevention systems or intrusion detection and firewalls, hackers are still able to pose major legal liability without even being detected or stopped.
                          Although there are numerous advantages of Web Application VAPT, some of the major ones are –

                          <h4>Why Network Penetration Testing?</h4>
                          <p align="justify">One of the major benefits of Network VAPT is that it will help you in gaining valuable insight into the in-scope assets’ security posture and being able to fix them before hackers can seriously damage them by exploiting the same. The overall time taken for completing the network penetration test completely depends upon the complexity and size of the in-scope network. Most of the tests can take from 1-4 weeks, from start to finish. The main focus is on recognizing systems and network-level flaws such as Misconfigurations, Wireless network vulnerabilities, Product-specific vulnerabilities, Weak protocols as well as passwords, and Rogue service.<br>
                          The network is regarded as an organization’s nerve system, storing its information as well as driving its communication. Through Network Security Audit, MSSP i.e., Managed Security Service Providers investigates the cybersecurity policies of the customer for making sure that the security factor stays intact. Your network permits everybody in an enterprise for accessing those tools which they require to be successful. However, your company should also ensure the fact that no one can gain unauthorized access. This is where Network Penetration testing can prove to be helpful as it identifies and then exploits the vulnerabilities in the user’s networks.

                          <h4>Mobile Application Penetration Testing</h4>
                          <p>Needless to say, Mobile apps have become a vital part of our day-to-day life as the dependence of humans on Smartphones has substantially grown. However, plenty of users are still unaware of their devices’ security. Safety can often become the false perception in case we do not have any idea of how our apps were developed as well as penetration testing</p>
                          <p>The most beneficial way to avoid any security risk is to opt for Mobile Application VAPT that holds the power of providing us with a definite level of confidence when it comes to security maintenance. According to various studies, more than 80% of mobile application users have the belief that their mobile finance and health apps are perfectly secure. Preliminary aim of conducting the Mobile App penetration test is to recognize all exploitable vulnerabilities in the app or network that can potentially get exploited by the hackers</p>

                          <h4>Compliance</h4>
                          <p>Information security management (ISM) describes controls that an organization needs to implement to ensure that it is sensibly protecting the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of assets from threats and vulnerabilities. An ISMS describes and demonstrates your organization’s approach to Information Security. It includes how people, policies, controls and systems identify, then address the opportunities and threats revolving around valuable information and related assets. It is worth reinforcing that for ISO 27001 success, certainly for independent certification, you need to implement and maintain a management system. Cybersecurity is all about addressing technology-led threats. Effective cybersecurity solutions are part of the broader ISMS.</p>
                          <blockquote>“What is ISO 27001?“</blockquote>
                          <p>ISO 27001 is one of the international standards that need to be followed by organization’s in order to ensure the security of information assets, whether it is details about the employees, financial information or any other information assigned to an organization by customers, vendors or any other third party. Keeping them secure will be a possibility by following the standards of ISO 27001.</p>

                          <h4>Windows Application Penetration Testing</h4>
                          <p>Most often, Desktop Application security is neglected by organizations and individuals. But, for ensuring complete protection of the company’s information assets, it is inevitable to secure your desktop apps any mobile application, web application, or network. With the auto-updates’ activation in operating systems, desktop apps have been continuously targeted by malicious attacks for gaining authorized access. To avoid any such situation in your organization, Desktop Application VAPT is essential for ensuring absolute information security. Its importance is just like that of other applications’ penetration testing.</p>

                            <h4>Why Desktop Application VAPT?</h4>
                            <p>Desktop Application Security Audit helps in recognizing threats to a company by proprietary applications or those delivered by the vendors with a bit or absolutely no customization. With its help, it becomes really easy for you to know whether the information systems are securing assets, maintaining the data integrity, and functioning effectively to achieve the objectives or goals of the organization.</p>
